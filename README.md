# DeepFake-Kaggle
DeepFake Kaggle competition

# Introduction
The main focus of DeepFakes is **face manipulation** at this point (early 2020). There are four types of face manipulation:

- entire face synthesis
- face identity swap (DeepFake)
- facial attributes manipulation
- facial expression manipulation

For each of these types, there are works about how fakes are created, and works on how to detect the fake ones. Refer to [this paper](docs/On\ the\ Detection\ of\ Digital\ Face\ Manipulation-CNN_Attention.pdf) for a comprehensive review of all these works.
